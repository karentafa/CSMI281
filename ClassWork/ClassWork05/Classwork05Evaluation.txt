Classwork05 Evaluation
======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

Tapiwa, you have really come a long way!  You should be
quite proud of yourself.

Your testing is adequate, but there is always room to do
more of it.  Try to test everything you can think of, and
try to verify that error conditions work, too!

Keep up the good work!
