Classwork03 Evaluation
======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

+ your code doesn't compile, there are compile errors when
   I run javac; you should make sure your code COMPILES
   when you commit it
+ your code looks nice, but doesn't compile so there is no
   way for me to evaluate it...
+ come and see me since I think you are still confused on
   a few things with Java and how the parts go together
